    <div class="section_div_line"></div>

    <p>Worship means total obedience to the commands of Allah. The Holy Prophet Muhammad(sa) brought the message of God and explained all the commandments concerning the religion of Islam.

        Islam has five basic duties which a Muslim has to perform. They are known as the Five Fundamentals of Islam or the Five Pillars of Islam.
        
        The first pillar of Islam is the Islamic declaration of faith, i.e. to bear witness that there is none worthy of worship except Allah, and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. The oneness of God is the basis of our belief in Islam.
        
        The second pillar is called Salat, i.e. to perform Prayer in a prescribed form.
        
        The third pillar is called Zakat, a form of levy which Muslims of means pay annually in cash or kind, and is spent for good causes mentioned in the Holy Quran.
        
        The fourth pillar is called Saum, i.e. to keep fasts in the month of Ramadan.
        
        The fifth pillar is called Hajj, i.e. to perform pilgrimage to the Ka‘bah in Mecca least once in the lifetime of a Muslim.
        
        Of all religious obligations, Islam has laid greatest emphasis on the institution of Salat. It is enjoined upon every Muslim to pray five times a day. Besides the five obligatory Prayers, there are other types of Prayers which are optional.
        
        A Muslim takes the spiritual side of life as seriously as a worldly person takes the material side of it. As air and food are essential for our physical life, likewise, we cannot survive spiritually without offering Salat or Prayer regularly in different parts of the day.
        
        Salat or Prayer, consists of various postures, i.e. Standing called Qiyam, Bowing down called Ruku‘, Prostration called Sajdah and Sitting called Qa‘dah. During each posture prescribed phrases are to be recited. As these phrases are in Arabic, every Muslim is required not only to memorise these verses but also to know their meaning so that the worshipper knows what he is saying to his Lord during the Prayer.

            The Holy Quran is the Book of Allah, the Almighty, which was revealed to the Holy Prophet Muhammad(sa) through the angel Gabriel. The Holy Quran is a complete code of life and a guide for mankind. It contains all the commandments of Allah and explains how to live a life in accordance with His will. The Holy Quran is a book of guidance for all mankind and it is the final revelation from Allah.

    <h1>
        Importance of Prayer
    </h1>
    <p>
                Salat or the prescribed Prayer has been mentioned in the Holy Quran as an essential characteristic of a true believer. The Holy Quran states:



        This is a perfect Book; there is no doubt in it; it is a guidance for the righteous, Who believe in the unseen and observe Prayer, and spend out of what We have provided for them; (2:3-4)

        Prayer or Salat, helps us to get rid of sins; inclines us more and more towards God and goodly things and so gradually purifies us. But this is not the end. Prayer does much more than this. It brings man closer to his Creator. The worshipper tries to imitate God in His most excellent attributes and is constantly transformed from a lowly and worldly person to a highly noble and sublime servant of God. The Holy Quran mentions this distinctive quality of Salat by saying:



        Recite that which has been revealed to thee of the Book, and observe Prayer. Surely, Prayer restrains one from indecency and manifest evil, and remembrance of Allah indeed is the greatest virtue. And Allah knows what you do. (29:46)

        Prayer is indeed a sure and well-tried prescription for purity of the heart and the soul. It is through Salat alone that we are able to establish a living communion with Allah. The Quran says:



        Surely, only those who follow the Book of Allah and observe Prayer and spend out of what We have provided for them, secretly and openly, hope for a bargain which will never fail; In order that He may give them their full rewards, and even increase them out of His bounty. He is surely Most Forgiving, Most Appreciating. (35:30-31)

        According to the Holy Prophet(sa) Salat is the pinnacle of the spiritual life of the believer. It is the highest form of Divine worship. The Holy Prophet(sa) is further reported to have observed:

        Prayer brings the believer into communion with his Lord.

        It must be realised that sincere prayer never goes in vain. Sometimes, the deep spiritual experience of the intense love of God brings tears to the eyes. Sometimes, a milder pleasure of love fills the heart with sublime happiness. These experiences are signs of the Prayer being alive, meaningful and fruitful. Otherwise, just a performance of formality is not enough to benefit man. That would be obeying an order without one’s heart being in it. That is why it is highly essential that every beginner should keep this noble objective before him and always try to make his Prayers come alive.

        The Salat combines all forms and degrees expressive of humility and submission. The worshippers stand in rows and respectfully behind the Imam.

        All the worshippers who line up behind the Imam must follow his movements at his call. The call for every movement is Allahu Akbar except when the Imam straightens himself from the position of Ruku‘, i.e. the bowing position, when instead of saying Allahu Akbar, he says Sami‘allahu Liman Hamidah which means ‘most certainly God listens to those who praise Him.’ At this call, all the followers also straighten up with arms by their sides, saying Rabbana Wa Lakal Hamd, Hamdan Kathiran Tayyiban Mubarakan Fihi.

        Sincerity and humility are the essence of prayer. Allah enjoins believers:



        Surely, success does come to the believers, Who are humble in their Prayers, (23:2-3)

        The Holy Prophet(sa) has said: No servant of Allah humbles himself for the sake of Allah, but Allah thereby brings about his Raf‘a. Raf‘a is an Arabic word meaning ‘to raise’. It does not mean that Allah will lift him bodily to heaven. Obviously it means that Allah will exalt his status before Him.

        True humility can only be achieved by mentally concentrating on the attributes of Allah. When His immense greatness dawns on someone, one has no choice but to be humbled.

    <h1>Obligation to Offer Prayers</h1>
    <p>
        Prayer, in the prescribed manner, is obligatory upon every adult Muslim of sound mind. As far as children are concerned, it is not obligatory on them until they come of age. However, it requires continuous effort and persuasion to get them to the stage where they start offering their Prayers regularly in the manner prescribed for the Prayer. Proper training and education is therefore necessary for children. It is for this reason that the Holy Prophet(sa) has directed that when children reach the age of seven, parents should urge them to be regular in their Prayers and when they reach the age of ten, they must be admonished if they fail to offer their Prayers regularly. (Sunan Abu Dawud, Kitabus-Salat).

Once the children reach the age of maturity, it becomes compulsory for them to offer their Prayers. At that stage, no individual or Government has the right to force them to offer their Prayers, as the Salat offered under compulsion does not mean anything. It ought to be offered willingly. The matter rests between the person and his God. Therefore, it is the duty of every and all Muslim parents to prepare their children for Salat from an early age. Moreover, it is highly essential for them to pray to God Almighty that their children become regular in Prayers. God’s help is sought because the task is huge.

It is mentioned in the Holy Quran that throughout his life Hadrat Ishmael(as) used to exhort members of his household to offer their Prayers regularly. It is often observed that in homes where elders offer their Prayers regularly, the children start copying the movements of their elders naturally and thus become regular in their Prayers, with time. However, when a child reaches the age of seven, the proper method of Prayer should be taught to him. He should be encouraged to join in Prayer and, if possible, he should be persuaded to accompany the parents to the mosque. This will develop in the child an affinity with Prayer,and will safeguard the habit of Prayer in the following generation. The parent or guardian, however, is permitted to be somewhat strict with the children between the ages of 10 to 12, should they become slack in offering their Prayers. This does not mean that they should be treated cruelly or punished, rather they should be admonished to the same degree as parents often admonish them for missing school. However, when they reach the age of twelve, they should be made to realise that their parents have discharged their duty and from that time on, the matter rests between them and God, to Whom they are answerable. This does not mean that they should not be advised, exhorted or admonished because as far as advising them is concerned, it can go on for life, if required. It is only the element of strictness which comes to an end when the child reaches the age of twelve. As mentioned earlier, Hadrat Ishmael(as) adopted the same method of love and kind persuasion with the members of his household. The Holy Prophet Muhammad(sa)treated the grown-ups in his family in the same manner. It is reported that he used to call out to his daughter Hadrat Fatimah(ra) and his son-in-law Hadrat ‘Ali(ra) to wake them up for Fajr Prayer.

    <h1> Timings for Prayers</h1>
    <p>
        For each of the five obligatory Prayers, there is an appointed time fixed in relation to the sun’s position.

The time of the Fajr or morning Prayer begins with dawn and ends just before sunrise.

The time of the Zuhr or midday Prayer begins after the sun has crossed the zenith point and has begun to decline.

The time of the ‘Asr Prayer is when the sun has further advanced in decline and reaches a point nearly halfway between the beginning of decline and sunset, which we may call late afternoon but not very late. It ends up quite some time before sunset, when the sunlight has paled. Although it is not entirely forbidden to say the ‘Asr Prayer that late in the day, it is most certainly preferred that it be offered before daylight has started fading out while the sun is still above the horizon by a good measure.

It is to be remembered that at the times of sunrise, sunset and when the sun is at its zenith, it is forbidden to offer Prayers. Also, when the ‘Asr Prayer has been performed, no optional Prayer should be offered between that time and the time of sunset. Similarly, between morning Prayer and sunrise no optional Prayer should be offered.

The time of Maghrib Prayer begins immediately after the sun has set. It lasts till dusk. But the word dusk is differently understood by the different schools of Jurists. The Wahhabis and similar sects with a rigid attitude insist that Maghrib Prayer should be offered almost immediately after sunset and that the time of dusk, according to them, ends when the redness of the sunset gives way to a dusky grey. Many other sects believe that dusk lasts still when there is some light left on the horizon after sunset. According to such schools, the allotted time for offering Maghrib Prayer is almost as long as that allotted for performing morning Prayer which lasts from early dawn to sunrise.

All schools of jurisprudence agree that the time for the ‘Isha’ Prayer begins when dusk has finally disappeared, giving way to the darkness of night. According to most, this period lasts till midnight but some even extend it beyond midnight till one retires for sleep. It is, however, very strongly advised and preferred that Prayers should be generally offered at the beginning of their respective times and should not be delayed until the time is about to run out.

    <h1>Ablution
    </h1>
    <p>
        The word ablution applies to washing some parts of the body preparatory to the performance of Prayer. This is a prerequisite which must be fulfilled, otherwise the Prayer will not be considered valid. The Hadith clearly instructs that one should wash one’s hands three times with water and then clean one’s mouth by rinsing with water three times.



Then, the nose should be internally cleaned by pushing a little water into the nostrils three times.



And then the entire face should be washed three times.



After this, the whole of the forearm up to and including the elbow should be washed three times each, starting with the right.



Then, having wetted the hands with some water again, a pass should be made over the head with both hands, palms downwards with thumbs outstretched so that almost the whole head is covered by this in a passing motion. At the end of this motion, the ears should be cleaned with the tips of the forefingers. The forefinger of the right hand is used for the right ear and the forefinger of the left hand is used for the left ear. The finger tips move along the crevices and grooves of the outside ear and are dipped slightly into the ear holes.



After passing the finger tips around the grooves of the external ear and dipping them into the ear holes, all fingers are joined together and the hands are inverted so that the palms now are facing outwards. With the back of the hands, a pass is made from the nape of the neck to the front of the neck.



Lastly the feet should be washed up to the ankles inclusive, three times each, again beginning with the right. If for some reason, the limbs are washed just once, or twice, during the ablution, the ablution is still complete, even though the best form of ablution is that which we find in the established Sunnah of the Holy Prophet Muhammad(sa) which is to wash the limbs three times. Thus the ablution is completed.



It is essential that the following prescribed prayer be recited for ablution:



Transliteration:

Allahummaj‘alni minat-tawwabina waj‘alni minal mutatahhirin.

Translation:

O Allah make me of those who seek forgiveness and make me of those who are cleansed.

This is ablution in normal circumstances when one is healthy and the use of water is not medically inadvisable, and where clean water is easily available. In case of illness or non-availability of water, there is a simple substitute for ablution in the following form which is called Tayammum.

If a clean dusty surface or a solid surface is available, one should pat the surface with the open palms of both hands, and make a motion with both hands passing them over one’s face. Then, one should pass the hands over the back of each other successively. If too much dust accumulates on the hands, then one is permitted to dislodge the excess. This is only a token ablution to remind one that whenever possible, proper ablution should be performed.

It is essential that one should offer Prayer while one’s ablution is intact. If one’s ablution remains intact then even with one ablution, more than one Prayer can be performed. This means that the state of ablution is necessary when one performs Prayer but for each Prayer repetition of ablution is not necessary if the previous ablution is still valid.

Factors Which Render an Ablution Ineffective
Passing wind.

Urination even if a drop has passed out.

Passing stool in however small quantity.

Sleeping, dozing off to the degree that if one were without a support, one would not be able to keep balance.

Menstruation and ejaculation, which have already been discussed earlier.

About vomiting and bleeding, opinions are divided but minor bleeding from any part of the body by an ordinary cut, etc., or throwing-up of a little food during belching should not be counted as bleeding and vomiting. Otherwise, after vomiting and bleeding, ablution should be performed again.

If after ablution, one puts on socks, then it is not essential to wash one’s feet for the following 24 hours when one performs ablution. Instead, one should wet one’s hands and after shaking off the excess water, one should make passes with the hands on both feet on top of the socks. This should be considered an alternative to the washing of the feet. This permission is extended to three days during a journey.

Some Noteworthy Differences of Opinion Among Different Schools of Jurisprudence
According to Shia jurisprudence, the feet are exempted from washing and only the passes as mentioned before are enough, whether one is wearing socks or not. According to some more rigid schools of thought like the Wahhabis, ordinary socks, whether they be woollen or cotton are not enough. Socks have to be made of thin leather which is impervious to dust and moisture, etc., in order to avail of such concession.

According to some other schools, this attitude is too strict and makes one slave to superficialities which is not in the true spirit of Islam. The Holy Prophet(sa) described the spirit of Islam by saying:



Transliteration:

Innaddina Yusrun.

Translation:

Indeed it is a religion of ease. (Bukhari, Kitabul-Iman)

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community agree with this. They consider the best policy is to apply common sense. So, if a pair of socks are thick enough to protect one’s feet from dirt and filth, the question of which material they are made of does not arise.

Bath
Taking a bath is always encouraged and promoted in Islam. Islam emphasises not only the cleanliness of the soul but also that of the body. In some situations however, it has been made a prerequisite to the offering of any formal Prayer. The following are the conditions which necessitate taking a bath and where ablution alone is not enough.

In Case of Women

After each menstruation when the flow of blood has completely stopped.

After childbirth when the bleeding has finally stopped. Note: During these bleeding periods, women are not required to perform formal Prayers.

In Case of Men and Women

After seminal ejaculation or orgasm, whether resulting from conjugation or from any other cause. The same applies to night discharges during sleep.

Sexual contact between man and woman, even without ejaculation and however brief it may be.

All non-Muslims who become Muslims are also obliged to take a bath and start a new, fresh life as a Muslim.

Additional Situations Where a Bath Is Essential
Every new born child must be bathed, and also the body of every person who has died should be bathed before the Janazah Prayer. However, for those who are martyred or killed during war or murdered in any way, an exception is made and they are not bathed.

Apart from the occasions when bathing becomes necessary, the taking of a bath every Friday, on the celebrations of ‘Id and just before performing Hajj were strongly emphasised by the Holy Prophet(sa).

It is interesting to note that the Holy Founder(sa) of Islam used to take a bath in the following manner:

He would start bathing by performing Wudu’, i.e. ablution, but not including washing of the feet which he would do at the end. Then he would pour water at least three times on the right side of his body, followed by three times on the left. He bathed so meticulously that every pore of every part of his body was washed thoroughly.

In all such conditions where bathing becomes obligatory, one can neither perform Prayer without bathing nor enter the mosque, nor recite the Holy Quran. Exception is made for women during their periods as far as the reading of the Holy Quran is concerned. They can read the Holy Quran but are advised not to touch it with their bare hands.

Water
Water to be used for ablution and bathing should be clean and salubrious. Stagnant or polluted water may not be used. However, when salubrious water is not available and people are forced to use whatever water is available, the same can also be used for ablution and bath.

    <h1>Conditions for Prayer
    </h1>
    <p>
        Some prerequisites and conditions exist regarding the offering of Prayers. They are as follows:

Determination of Intention: The intention to perform a Prayer must be made prior to the beginning of the Prayer.

The Prayer should be offered within the fixed time allotted for that particular Prayer. However, it should be remembered that if one fails to perform a Prayer in time due to some compelling reasons, that Prayer can be offered whenever one remembers it. However, it should not be offered at forbidden times. The question arises that if the timings for Prayer and fasting, etc., are associated with the duration of sunlight, with the rotation of the earth and the relative position of the sun and moon, how could one determine the timings of Prayer and fasting in extreme Southern and Northern areas where the duration of days and nights are longer than twenty-four hours? It should be noted that the Holy Prophet(sa) replying to a question from a Companion, explained that in those areas where the days and nights are of longer duration as compared to the normal 24-hour day, Muslims should offer their Prayers by measuring time in accordance with the normal length of a day.

One should be clean in body and, as far as possible, in mind and spirit also. Cleanliness here is a term which means:

The body should be clean from all filth.

If one has answered the call of nature and has been to the toilet, one should wash oneself properly so that all remnants of faeces or urine have been properly washed away.

After conjugation, whether ejaculation has taken place or not or when, in whatever manner, ejaculation has taken place, for instance during sleep, cleanliness would mean not just washing oneself partially, but a full bath becomes essential.A full bath is also essential for women after menstruation, and after post-parturition bleeding (bleeding following childbirth).

The place and mat of Prayer must be neat and clean.

The body must be properly covered during the Prayer.

Qiblah or Direction: All Muslims must face towards the Ka‘bah. Qiblah means facing the Ka‘bah in Makkah, the first House of worship built on earth.

All Muslims throughout the world should always face the general direction of the Ka‘bah during every Prayer. However, during a journey and when travelling, if one fails to determine the direction properly or when one is unable to face towards the Ka‘bah because of illness, for it is beyond one’s capacity to do so, then one is not obliged to face towards the Qiblah. Also, when on a journey, riding on a mount, train, boat or plane, one should say one’s Prayers facing in the same direction towards which one is moving, or indeed any convenient position will be acceptable.
